# 🐧 DevOps Shell Scripting & Linux Basics

## 🔰 Shebang
```bash
#!/bin/bash
Used at the start of shell scripts to indicate the interpreter.

🔐 File Permissions
bash
Copy
Edit
chmod 777 filename
Sets full permissions (read, write, execute) for:

7 – Owner (root)

7 – Group

7 – Others (me)

Permission values:

1 – Execute

2 – Write

4 – Read

⚙️ Why Shell Scripts in DevOps?
Shell scripts are widely used for:

Infrastructure maintenance

Lightweight automation on Linux systems

Git operations

Configuration management

🧠 System Monitoring Commands
Command	Description
top	Live view of CPU, memory, and disk usage
df -h	Human-readable disk usage info
free	Displays memory usage
nproc	Number of CPU cores

🧰 Process Management
ps -ef: Shows all running processes.

ps -ef | grep "audited" | awk -F" " '{print $2}': Finds a specific process and prints its PID.

kill -9 <PID>: Force kills a process by PID.

🧪 Debugging & Execution
set -x: Enable debug mode in shell scripts (logs each command before execution).

sudo su -: Switch to root user.

🔍 Log Analysis
curl <log_file> or wget <url>: Downloads content or logs.

Combine with grep:

bash
Copy
Edit
curl logfile.log | grep "ERROR"
wget: Downloads files and saves them locally; useful for automation.

🔎 File & Directory Utilities
sudo find / -name pam: Searches entire system for folders/files named "pam".

sort: Sorts lines in files alphabetically or numerically.

🔁 Links
Soft Links (Symbolic): Memory-based shortcuts to a file.

Hard Links: Actual duplicate of the original file; can be reused even if the original is deleted.

🌐 Network Utilities
traceroute <hostname>: Tracks the route packets take.

tracepath <hostname>: Similar to traceroute, often with fewer privileges.

🔄 Log Management
logrotate: Automatically rotates and compresses logs.

Uses formats like .gzip or .zip to archive older logs.
